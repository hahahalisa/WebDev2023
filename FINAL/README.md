Development of My Midterm Proposal 

Since I planned to continue with my midterm project for my final website, I began with brainstorming ideas, exploring new features that I can add to the website, and researching other similar-themed websites for inspiration such as the official Animal Crossing and Nintendo websites. During the brainstorming process, I thought about the new exciting javascript components and features I want to incorporate, such as a music player, calculator, and image galleries. Since my knowledge of javascript was very limited when I was working on my midterm project, I felt like I didn’t have many options to play with. I now feel pretty confident with my HTML/CSS skills and believe that I have a solid understanding of basic javascript, I definitely want to explore and add more javascript features to my final website. I jotted down my abstract ideas and most importantly, I played Animal Crossing which highly helped me to think about the new content I could put on the website. I recently bought an extension pack of Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing Happy Home Paradise, which focuses on building dream vacation homes for various villagers while working at the company “Happy Home.” I definitely wanted to develop a new page dedicated to this content. 

Developing Sketches and Wireframes 

When I had a list of potential ideas and layouts, I started to make low-fidelity sketches and wireframes. Since I tend to focus better when I sketch with a pen on paper, I started sketching wireframes very roughly just to have a clearer understanding of my ideas and the potential layout of the website. I then started to build low-fidelity wireframes using Figma, building the overall structure and layout of the new features and pages. While I was developing wireframes, I came up with a new idea for the Happy Home page. I decided to make the page an informational page about what a “Happy Home” is, its interior design team, its values, and built vacation homes by Happy Home. I developed a low-fidelity wireframe for this page as well. 

Building Skeletons 

After creating low-fidelity sketches and wireframes, I started building skeletons and frameworks. I focused on creating the structure and layout using HTML and Javascript. 

Developing & Incorporating Bootstraps 

Once I had a basic framework in place, I started adding and developing more functionality using Javascript and Bootstrap. Since I was not that familiar with Bootstrap, I spent a whole day browsing through different Bootstrap features and components. I incorporated several Bootstrap components into the website, such as the carousel gallery, cards, and pop-up modals. I was truly surprised by how easy and convenient Bootstrap is. When I was learning Bootstrap during class, I felt a bit lost since it is my first time using Bootstrap, but once I got used to it, I found it to be a very powerful and flexible tool which made it easy for me to create complex features. When I was developing the Turnip Calculator, I relied on my class notes which helped me understand the logistics much better. I also implemented and modified the tab gallery feature on W3 Schools to make the page more interactive instead of just scrolling through one single image. 

Finding the Right Color Schemes & CSS

After building the framework, I began to apply CSS to add design and modify the default Bootstrap CSS. Since I want my website to be pastel-themed, I used Coolors, which is a color scheme generator, to get inspiration for the right color scheme. I screenshotted every color scheme that I liked and saved them on Figma so that I can easily use the spoiler to get the HEX code of each color. For the Happy Home pages, I wanted it to be tropical-themed as it focuses on building vacation homes on a tropical island, I created a mood board to get a better understanding of the style and the color scheme that I am aiming for. I also used many online tools such as Coolor and Adobe Color to experiment with different combinations and generate tropical color palettes. After finding the right color schemes, I started to apply them to the website using CSS.

Making It Responsive & Media Query

Once I completed building the website, I began to focus on making it responsive using media queries. Since everything was built on a desktop-sized screen, I had to adjust a lot of elements based on the size of the mobile screen, such as the font size, line height, box size, image size, etc. 

Consistency 

After completing the website’s development, I focused on achieving consistency throughout the website. I made sure to use the same fonts, colors, and styling throughout the website. I used a consistent color palette and typography, and I made sure that every header had the same margins and paddings. I also made sure the layout and design of each page followed a consistent structure, and that the cards, boxes, and images are spaced out evenly.
