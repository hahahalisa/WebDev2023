I recently got into playing Animal Crossing on my Nintendo Switch and I really want to create a website that is related to Animal Crossing!
Although I am not exactly sure which aspect of the game I want to focus on for the project, I am planning to create a promotional website which 
advertises the Nook Shop (the shop name in the game), introducing the store's history, what they sell for today (as the Nook Shop sells different
items every day in the game), their special items for the week, shop news, etc. 
The website will have a navigation bar at the top with 2-3 sections (supposedly) and I definitely also want to include the gifs or photos of the 
main figures (Timmy and Tommy) who run the Nook Shop in the game. 
I am going to incorporate the main theme colors of Animal Crossing (pastel-like/forest theme). The main homepage is mosty likely going to be about
the items that the shop sells for today.
