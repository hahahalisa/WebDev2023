I recently got into playing Animal Crossing on my Nintendo Switch and I really want to create a website that is related to Animal Crossing!
Although I am not exactly sure which aspect of the game I want to focus on for the project, I am planning to create a promotional website which 
advertises the Nook Shop (the shop name in the game), introducing the store's history, what they sell, their special items, etc.
